## Usage
Our app offers browsing functionality without requiring an account. However, to initiate contact with a musician, logging in is necessary. A convenient button will guide you to either the login or signup page, depending on your account status.

During the signup process, users will input basic information to establish their profile. Additionally, users will be prompted to indicate if they are musicians themselves. If so, they can proceed to create a musician page, transforming from a regular user to an active musician, poised for their next performance.

Once logged in or signed up, users gain access to several features, including the ability to:
* Initiate contact with musicians
* Bookmark favorite musicians
* Explore musicians based on the city of interest.
